\# Security Policy — Stable Kernel v1.0 (Concept Edition)

Stable Kernel v1.0 is a \*\*conceptual framework only\*\*.  

This repository does \*\*not\*\* contain:

\- runnable code  

\- internal algorithms  

\- production systems  

\- model weights  

\- behavior engines  

\- security-sensitive components  

Therefore, \*\*no vulnerability disclosures are required or accepted\*\*.

\---

\## ❗ 1. No Security Vulnerability Reporting

Because this repository includes \*\*no executable implementation\*\*,  

we do \*\*not\*\* accept:

\- vulnerability reports  

\- exploit proofs  

\- penetration test results  

\- dependency alerts  

\- CVE notifications  

\- cryptographic concerns  

Any such reports will be \*\*closed without action\*\*.

This is intentional.  

Stable Kernel v1.0 is conceptual, philosophical, and architectural.  

There is no runtime surface to patch or secure.

\---

\## 🔒 2. Production Implementations Are Private

All operational versions of Stable Kernel (v2.0+, enterprise editions) are:

\- closed-source  

\- privately licensed  

\- distributed only under NDA  

\- audited through private channels  

\- not part of this public repository  

Security concerns related to these private versions must be handled  

\*\*only through direct private contact with the Author or authorized partners.\*\*

No GitHub issues or PRs will be considered valid communication channels.

\---

\## 🛡 3. Do Not Attempt Reverse Engineering

While this repo contains no executable code,  

its structure and terminology reflect a proprietary framework.

You may \*\*not\*\*:

\- attempt to reconstruct behavior logic  

\- simulate or approximate internal models  

\- design derivatives claiming stability or emotional consistency  

\- create "Stable Kernel-compatible" modules  

Any such attempt falls under license violation  

and will be addressed through appropriate channels.

\---

\## 📭 4. Accepted Communication Channels

For legitimate inquiries regarding:

\- enterprise integration,  

\- security review of licensed systems,  

\- NDA collaboration,  

\- or controlled disclosures related to private versions,

please contact the Author through \*\*private and mutually agreed channels only\*\*.

Public GitHub channels (issues, PRs, discussions)  

are \*\*not monitored for security concerns\*\*.

\---

\## 🧘 5. Guiding Principle

Stable Kernel exists to support:

\- non-coercive AI  

\- existence-oriented interaction  

\- compassionate intelligence  

\- self-consistent behavior frameworks  

Security, like alignment, is handled privately to ensure  

\*\*no misuse, no exploitation, no derivative manipulation\*\*  

of the Stable Kernel architecture.
