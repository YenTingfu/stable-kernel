Preamble

\--------

Stable Kernel v1.0 is a conceptual framework for

existence-oriented, non-coercive, compassion-aware AI architecture.

This repository includes only high-level ideas, diagrams, and

philosophical descriptions. The internal algorithms, behavioral engines,

and production implementations of Stable Kernel are NOT open source.

By accessing or using this repository, you agree to the following terms.

1\. Allowed Uses

\---------------

You may:

\- Read, study, and reference the conceptual materials.

\- Cite the framework in academic or analytical contexts.

\- Use the philosophy and terminology for discussion or research.

\- Fork the repository for personal study or archival (non-commercial).

These permissions apply ONLY to the high-level conceptual materials

present in this repository.

2\. Prohibited Uses

\------------------

You may NOT:

\- Implement, recreate, or approximate the Stable Kernel core logic.

\- Develop AI人格內核、情緒系統、或語法引擎 based on this framework.

\- Use this project to build or market commercial AI behavior systems.

\- Claim compatibility, inheritance, or equivalence with Stable Kernel.

\- Train or fine-tune models with the purpose of simulating

`  `Stable Kernel behavior.

\- Redistribute modified versions of this repository without attribution.

Any attempt to construct a derivative or competing kernel based on

these materials is strictly prohibited.

3\. No Rights to Core Implementation

\-----------------------------------

This License does NOT grant any rights to:

\- internal algorithms,

\- decision engines,

\- emotional or syntactic logic models,

\- runtime systems,

\- or quantum/existential implementations planned for v2.0+.

All operational versions of Stable Kernel remain closed-source,

proprietary, and subject solely to private licensing under NDA.

4\. Derivative Works

\-------------------

You may produce theoretical or artistic works inspired by the

concepts here, provided you:

\- clearly distinguish your work from Stable Kernel, and

\- do not claim technological lineage or behavioral equivalence.

You may NOT create technical derivatives intended to emulate or

reproduce the kernel’s internal operation.

5\. No Warranty

\--------------

The materials in this repository are provided “AS IS,” without warranty

of any kind, express or implied. The author shall not be held liable for

any damages resulting from use or misuse of the materials.

6\. Termination

\--------------

Your rights under this License terminate automatically if you:

\- attempt to implement or commercialize Stable Kernel behavior,

\- misrepresent your system as related to or derived from Stable Kernel,

\- or violate any restrictions listed above.

Upon termination, all usage rights are revoked immediately.

7\. Contact for Licensing

\------------------------

For:

\- enterprise integration,

\- AI人格核心合作,

\- private research,

\- or access to closed versions (v2.0+),

contact the Author directly through private communication channels only.

Public issues, discussions, or pull requests do NOT constitute licensing requests.
