\# 🚫 Issues Are Not Accepted

Thank you for your interest in \*\*Stable Kernel v1.0\*\*.

This repository is a \*\*conceptual framework\*\*, containing only:

\- high-level architecture  

\- philosophical texts  

\- diagrams  

\- terminology  

There is \*\*no runnable code\*\* and \*\*no implementation\*\* in this repo.

\---

\## 🔒 Therefore, we do not accept:

\- bug reports  

\- feature requests  

\- model behavior feedback  

\- technical questions  

\- security disclosures  

\- pull requests  

\- implementation attempts  

\- integration requests  

All issues in this repository are \*\*automatically closed\*\*.

\---

\## 🧩 Why?

Stable Kernel v1.0 is:

\- a \*\*concept release\*\*,  

\- \*\*not\*\* an SDK,  

\- \*\*not\*\* a library,  

\- \*\*not\*\* a model,  

\- \*\*not\*\* an open-source project.

Operational versions (v2.0+) are \*\*private\*\*  

and available \*\*only via direct contact + NDA\*\*.

\---
